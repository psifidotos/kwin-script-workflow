(based on differences from the WorkFlow plasmoid)

0.4.0
=====
-- added two buttons on the right, one for configuration and one for closing the script 
-- added TopLeft hot corner to enable the script and a global shortcut also Meta+Ctrl+Z
-- added an inline configuration dialog in order to set some settings (the settings
      can not be stored yet so they are per kwin session)
-- changed previews workaround and used default previews from kwin, this way exiting
      use cases appear... e.g. when scrolling previews in the Workarea Dialog the previews
      are croped
-- changed/added tweaks in order for all the features to be supported also with the kwin script
