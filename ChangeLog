0.3.0
=====
- Differences from 0.3.0 plasmoid
-- added two buttons on the right, one for configuration and one for closing the script 
-- droped previews workaround and used default previews from kwin, this way exiting
   use cases appear... e.g. when scrolling previews in the Workarea Dialog the previews
   can be croped
-- added TopLeft hot corner to enable the script and a global shortcut also Meta+Ctrl+Z
-- create an inline configuration dialog in order to set some settings (be careful settings
   can not be stored yet so these are per session use)
-- tweak a bit in order all the features to be supported also with the kwin effect
